# Tourism Recommender

## Scenario

There are hundreds of years-old historical structures that preserve a country's and community's history for future generations and promote tourism opportunities.

To help the travel and tourism industries, it has been decided to use advanced machine learning techniques to monitor the condition of these historical structures and report to government agencies if any of them need maintenance.

Also, understanding customers (tourists) and their expectations is critical for effective marketing. A recommendation engine is an excellent way to supplement existing marketing outreach to prospects.

## Tasks
Perform exploratory data analysis and develop a recommendation engine that will help tourists visit their places of interest.
